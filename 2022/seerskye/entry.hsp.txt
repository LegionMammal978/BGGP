Target Software and Version: A sample program bundled with the windows
release of Hot Soup Processor version 3.6
Description of Target Software's Environment (Platform/OS, Setup
Instructions, etc.):
Exploit found on Windows 10. To build:
1. Download and Extract Hot Soup Processor 3.6 from
https://github.com/onitama/OpenHSP/releases/tag/v3.6
2. Open the IDE program `hsed3.exe`
3. In the editor open `sample\hspda\vtest1.hsp`
4. Compile the program by hitting F7 or using HSP -> Compile in the top menu
5. There should now be an exe named `hsptemp.exe` in the
`sample\hspda` directory. Copy it to another location along with the
`hspda.dll` found in the root hsp directory.
6. Place my file in the same directory with the name
`vtest_data.var`. Open the program. The crash is inconsistent based on
garbage values in memory. If the program starts up normally, you will
either need to replace the file after closing before trying again (as
the program will save over it) or force quit the program in task
manager to prevent it from overwriting the file.
Note that you won't reproduce the crash if you start the program
with a debugger attached! This is because starting in a debugger will
cause the windows heap to place special values in uninitialized
memory. The file loader will see the 0xABABABAB guard bytes after the
file and not try to load further because the number isn't greater than
0.
Target File Type: The variable files saved and loaded by the hspda.dll
plugin for the Hot Soup Processor programming language. The format
does not have an official name, I've been calling them `hspv` files
after the file magic `hspv\0`.

Brief Description of Crash: File consisting of only the file magic
crashes hspda.dll
Was this a new crash, or a known bug? New to me, but because almost
everything about HSP is in Japanese I have no idea if the bug is
known.
