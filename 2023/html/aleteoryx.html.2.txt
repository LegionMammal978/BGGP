Target Environment (How do we run the file?): open in a web browser. that's it.
Any additional info?: this could, in theory, be about 8 bytes smaller, but the browser-native apis for getting HTML content add extra formatting, and i feel like it would be cheating to submit something that only outputs an *equivalent* file, as opposed to a properly identical one.
