Target File Type: COM (MS-DOS executable)
SHA256 Hash: f041db85a0e2dce43c7e7d26887d3eff5c80da130831912f7d9aca10fcd1d494
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): DOSBox https://www.dosbox.com/
Any additional info?: @cvtsi2sd@hachyderm.io gave me the tip to save 1 byte by replacing MOV BX, AX with XCHG AX, BX.
Instructions to run:
1. Create a directory -- say, $HOME/bggp. Name the file BGGP.COM in this directory.
2. Run DOSBOX. In the prompt, run `MOUNT B: ~/bggp`, then `B:` to change to that drive.
3. Run the program: `BGGP`.
4. As shown in the screenshot, you may verify that the program returned 4 by running the command `IF ERRORLEVEL 4 IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 5 ECHO success`.
5. I don't think there is a diff tool built in to DOSBox, but you can verify that BGGP.COM and 4 are identical outside of DOSBox.
