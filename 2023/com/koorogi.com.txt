MS-DOS, but known to work in dosbox.
Name the file to end with '.com' and run from DOS prompt.
No arguments or special setup is necessary.

Any additional info?:
Terminates with exit code of 4. Confirming this is a pain in DOS.
Run these commands at the DOS prompt immediately after the program to
verify that the exit code is at least 4, but is not at least 5:

if errorlevel 5 echo exit code was at least 5
if errorlevel 4 echo exit code was at least 4
