Target File Type: SelfXSS (javascript: URL)
SHA256 Hash: e1ccc7be78fce2d1c16dfb9eee2fb08765811318e6365a2724dbcdf142e6ff58
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): This one is a bit more complicated, because browsers have a selfXSS protection. You have to paste the URL, but it will delete the text "javascript:". You have to *manually type* that on the beginning of the URL and inside the btoa() call so it matches with the source again. Then just hit enter and enjoy the show. Also, you need to be on a website that doesn't block javascript: URLs via CSP, so I recommend running this on https://example.com/.
Any additional info?: 102 bytes. Some browsers enforce a file ending in the file picker, but the actual name (as you can see in the screenshot) is 4.
