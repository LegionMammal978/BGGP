Target File Type: Shebang only (without subshell spawning)
SHA256 Hash: 0196ff3b228266bbfcda2a7b7e7f9667c318add94a44642f5fb516cd89d422e0
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): chmod +x [file] && ./[file]
Any additional info?: 45 bytes. The whole file is *just* a shebang, *without spawning any subshells*. Assuming that the GNU coreutils are present, running on Arch Linux (which has /bin/env). Also, this produces a file called x04, which is 4 in hexadecimal. I read through all man pages and even parts of the coreutils source code, and to my knowledge it's impossible to get "4" without a subshell, but hex 4 is possible, so I am submitting this.
